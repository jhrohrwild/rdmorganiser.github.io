Different stakeholders are pursuing the development of such discipline-specific DMP templates in different ways. In this paper, we present three such approaches. First, we introduce the concept of domain data protocols, describing the work of the project Domain Data Protocols for Empirical Educational Research (in Germany). Members of this project develop tailored guidance on research data management (RDM) vertically, i.e., within the educational research discipline. Second, we present the approach of the Research Data Alliance Working Group on Discipline-specific Guidance for DMPs. The working group identifies discipline-specific DMP characteristics and uses them to analyse common practices and differences in RDM horizontally across disciplines. Finally, we describe the approach of the Research Data Management Organiser Sub-Working Group on Guidance, which facilitates mapping of discipline-specific DMP templates across disciplines. Although these three approaches differ in their underlying concepts, combining them facilitates identifying differences and commonalities in RDM across disciplines. By assigning discipline-specific characteristics and mapping these characteristics across disciplines, the three approaches improve our understanding of data management and research data within a particular discipline, as well as across disciplines.","2022-03-14","2023-09-26 13:56:25","2024-09-02 10:03:38","2023-09-26 13:56:25","13-25","","1","","","","Activities and Challenges in developing Discipline-Specific Data Management Plan Templates","","","","","","","de","Copyright (c) 2022 Sebastian Netscher, Ivonne Anders, Christin Henzen","","","","bausteine-fdm.de","","Number: 1","","","","","DMP; Anleitungen; Data Management Plan; disciplin-specific; fachspezifisch; Guidance; Template","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The DMP Common Standards WG has developed an application profile that allows to express information from traditional DMPs in a machine-actionable way. It allows for automatic exchange, integration, and validation of information provided in DMPs.

Nicht nur, dass verschiedene Förderorganisationen wie die National Science Foundation (USA), der Schweizerische Nationalfonds (SNF), die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) sowie die Europäische Kommission mit Horizon 2020 (H2020) bereits bei Projektanträgen Auskunft über den Umgang mit den nachgenutzten oder erstellten Forschungsdaten verlangen, es beschäftigen sich auch mehr und mehr Initiativen wie zum Beispiel international die Research Data Alliance oder in Deutschland die DINI/nestor-Arbeitsgruppe Forschungsdaten mit dem Thema. International setzt sich dabei mehr und mehr die Erkenntnis durch, dass es im Umgang mit Forschungsdaten nicht mit einem einmaligen Erstellen eines Forschungsdatenmanagementplans getan ist, sondern dass sich die Pläne aktiv dem Verlauf des Forschungsprozesses anpassen und für verschiedene Bedarfe zur Verfügung gestellt werden müssen. So kann es sinnvoll und notwendig sein, weitere Beteiligte wie zum Beispiel IT-Support oder übergeordnete Datenmanager beim Erstellen und Aktualisieren eines Forschungsdatenmanagementplans zu berücksichtigen. Daher muss ein Werkzeug zur Unterstützung von diesen Plänen über das bloße Ausfüllen von Vorlagen der Förderorganisation hinaus weitere Aufgaben erfüllen und so den gesamten Prozess des Forschungsdatenmanagements unterstützen. Der Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) ist ein solches Werkzeug, das im Rahmen eines DFG-Projektes entwickelt und mit Hilfe unterschiedlicher Gruppen von Nutzenden getestet wurde. Das RDMO-Tool ist multilingual, flexibel an Community- und Organisationsanforderungen anpassbar und unterstützt verschiedene Aufgaben wie zum Beispiel unterschiedliche Export-Funktionen oder die Erledigung zeitlich gebundener Tasks. In einem DFG-Nachfolgeprojekt, das Ende 2017 gestartet ist, werden in RDMO wichtige Erweiterungen sowohl technischer Art als auch bezogen auf verschiedene Aspekte der Nachhaltigkeit vorgenommen.","2018-04-01","2024-05-13 10:12:14","2024-05-13 10:12:14","2024-05-13 10:12:14","55-64","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","de","De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","","","","www.degruyter.com","","Publisher: De Gruyter","","C:\Users\lanza01\Zotero\storage\E6EX7PGH\Neuroth et al. - 2018 - Aktives Forschungsdatenmanagement.pdf; C:\Users\lanza01\Zotero\storage\NP2DP763\RIS_RDMO.ris","","","active research data management; documentation of research data; research data management plan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While DMP are in principle a great tool to optimise the data management during all stages of a research project and to serve as a roadmap for the various data management tasks, their current usage is strongly focused on the requirements of funding agencies. Existing software tools for DMP creation and editing are useful in that respect, but do not sufficiently support the full data life cycle of a project. The RDMO is meant to be a companion for data management issues during and after the whole project. Starting from a structured interview about the project and the data involved, it organizes the data management along tasks and comprises all relevant stakeholders, i.e. researchers, PIs, institutional data managers, IT departments. Adaptations to discipline-specific or institutional needs are supported. The installation of the tool into local environments and its integration into existing administrative IT infrastructure and work flows is given special consideration. The tool is multilingual (at first German and English). In my talk, I will present the different features of the software, show its current stage of development, and how RDMO can be deployed for your institution.","2017-04-01","2024-05-13 10:14:08","2024-07-30 12:50:24","2024-05-13 10:14:08","15760","","","","","","","EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2017EGUGA..1915760K","","C:\Users\lanza01\Zotero\storage\RZ5T79M4\Klar et al. - RDMO - Research Data Management Organiser.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EGU General Assembly Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Allerdings existieren bisher nur wenige technische Plattformen für diese Aufgabe, die eine Verwaltung der Forschungsdaten anhand der FAIR-Prinzipien ermöglicht und dabei den gesamten Forschungsdatenlebenszyklus betrachten. Hier stellen wir das Projekt „Management molekularer Daten im Research Data Life Cycle“ (MaMoDaR) vor. MaMoDaR hat als Ziel, eine technische Plattform zu entwickeln, die den effizienten und nachhaltigen Umgang mit molekularen Forschungsdaten ermöglicht. Die Software unterstützt Wissenschaftler*innen darin im Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) hinterlegte Projekte auffindbar zu machen, Forschungsdaten direkt mit diesen Projekten zu verknüpfen und in öffentlichen Repositorien nach den FAIR-Prinzipien zu veröffentlichen. Neben unseren Erfahrungen beim Entwickeln dieser Software beschreiben wir in dieser Arbeit, dass es für den Erfolg einer Plattform nicht ausreicht, eine benutzerfreundliche Softwarelösung bereitzustellen, die sich auf das Forschungsdatenmanagement fokussiert. Vielmehr ist es notwendig, Forschende auch in organisationalen Prozessen zu unterstützen. Für die Umsetzung und das Gelingen eines institutionellen Forschungsdatenmanagements muss der Mehrwert für Wissenschaftler*innen direkt erfahrbar werden.","2021","2024-07-08 09:31:52","2024-07-08 09:31:52","2024-07-08 09:31:52","27-38","","3","","","","Erfahrungsbericht","","","","","","","de","Copyright (c) 2021 Luca Leipold, Janine Straka, Kyanoush Yahosseini","","","","bausteine-fdm.de","","Number: 3","","","","","Erfahrungsbericht; Ganzheitliches Forschungsdatenmanagement; RDMO; Workshop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So verlangen verschiedene Förderorganisationen wie die National Science Foundation (USA), der Schweizerische Nationalfonds (SNF), die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft sowie die Europäische Kommission mit Horizon 2020 (H2020) bereits bei Projektanträgen Auskunft über den Umgang mit den nachgenutzten oder erstellten Forschungsdaten. Auch beschäftigen sich zahlreiche Initiativen wie zum Beispiel international die Research Data Alliance (RDA) oder in Deutschland die DINI/nestor-Arbeitsgruppe Forschungsdaten mit dem Thema. International setzt sich dabei die Erkenntnis durch, dass es im Umgang mit Forschungsdaten nicht mit einem einmaligen Erstellen eines Forschungsdatenmanagementplans getan ist, sondern dass sich die Pläne aktiv und dynamisch dem Verlauf des Forschungsprozesses anpassen und entsprechend aktualisiert werden müssen. Darüber hinaus sollen DMP für verschiedene Bedarfe zur Verfügung gestellt werden, um die spezifischen Sichtweisen unterschiedlicher Beteiligter abbilden zu können. Ein DMP-Werkzeug, das solche Pläne unterstützt, kann so etwa verschiedene Bedarfserhebungen (z.B. Speicher-Bedarf, Kosten etc.) für unterschiedliche Rollen (z.B. Forschungsreferat, Projektleitung, IT-Support) ermöglichen. Der Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) ist ein solches Werkzeug, das im Rahmen eines DFG-Projektes entwickelt und mit Hilfe unterschiedlichen Zielgruppen getestet wurde.

Dabei rücken in den letzten Jahren verstärkt Open Science-Paradigmen, wie der möglichst offene Zugang zu den Daten und die FAIR Data Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reuseable) in den Fokus. Diese bedeuten einen Paradigmenwechsel für Wissenschaftler*innen und Wissenschafts- und Gedächtnisinstitutionen und erfordern die Kooperation im Rahmen nationaler und internationaler Infrastrukturen. Zur Förderung guter Datenmanagementpraktiken verlangen verschiedene nationale und internationale Förderorganisationen bei Projektanträgen Auskunft über den Umgang mit nachgenutzten oder erstellten Forschungsdaten, z. B. in der Form von Datenmanagementplänen (DMPs). Inzwischen setzt sich die Erkenntnis durch, dass es nicht mit einem einmaligen Datenmanagementplan getan ist, sondern dass DMPs während des Projektverlaufs angepasst werden müssen, um das Forschungsdatenmanagement aktiv und unter Einbeziehung aller relevanten Stakeholder zu unterstützen und seine Potenziale auszuschöpfen (aktives Forschungsdatenmanagement). Hierfür wird im Rahmen eines DFG-Projekts das Werkzeug Research Data Management Organizer (RDMO) entwickelt. Der Vortrag gibt eine Einführung in die wichtigsten Begrifflichkeiten und Konzepte des geisteswissenschaftlichen Forschungsdatenmanagements und seine Bedeutung für die Sicherung der guten wissenschaftlichen Praxis, die Qualitätssicherung der Forschungsdaten und die Erhöhung des Impacts der Resultate digitaler geisteswissenschaftlicher Forschung und führt diesbezüglich in Funktionalitäten und Anwendungsmöglichkeiten des Werkzeugs RDMO ein.

Many research institutions have disparate and fragmented data that make it difficult to uphold the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data management principles. At the same time, there is minimal practice of open and reproducible science. To solve these challenges, we designed and implemented an IS architecture for research data management. Through it, we have a centralized platform for research data management. The IS has several software components that are configured and unified to communicate and share data. The software components are, namely, common ontology, data management plan, data collectors, and the data warehouse. Results show that the IS components have gained global traction, 56.3% of the total web hits came from news users, and 259 projects had metadata (and 17 of those also had data resources). Moreover, the IS aligned the institution's scientific data resources to universal standards such as the FAIR principles of data management and at the same time showcased open data, open science, and reproducible science. Ultimately, the architecture can be adopted by other organizations to manage research data.","2022","2024-07-08 09:28:01","2024-09-02 10:04:08","","3196","","19","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To support the stakeholders' decision, the quality of the spatial data and its assurance play a major role. We present concepts and a workflow to assure the quality of ESS data. Our concepts and workflow are designed along the research data life cycle and include criteria for openness, FAIRness of data (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), data maturity, and data quality. Existing data maturity concepts describe (community-specific) maturity matrices, e.g., for meteorological data. These concepts assign a variety of maturity metrics to discrete levels to facilitate evaluation of the data. Moreover, the use of easy-to-understand level numbers enables quick recognition of highly mature data, and hence fosters easier reusability. Here, we propose a revised maturity matrix for ESS data including a comprehensive list of FAIR criteria. To foster the compatibility with the developed maturity matrix approach, we developed a spatial data quality matrix that relates the data maturity levels to quality metrics. The maturity and quality levels are then assigned to the phases of the data life cycle. With implementing openness criteria and matrices for data maturity and quality, we build a quality assurance (QA) workflow that comprises various activities and roles. To support researchers in applying this workflow, we implement an interactive questionnaire in the tool RDMO (research data management organizer) to collaboratively manage and monitor all QA activities. This can serve as a blueprint for use-case-specific QA for other datasets. As a proof of concept, we successfully applied our criteria for openness, data maturity, and data quality to the publicly available SPAM2010 (crop distribution) dataset series.","2022","2024-07-08 09:28:01","2024-09-02 10:04:23","","334","","6","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sie sollten sich auf forschungsdaten.info über Forschungsdatenmanagement informieren und an Best Practices orientieren können. Das Angebot stützte sich dabei auf den im Landesprojekt bwFDM-Communities identifizierten Bedarfen.Im Nachfolgeprojekt bwFDM-Info II verschob sich der Fokus hin zum Bekanntmachen der Plattform und Etablieren ihres nachhaltigen Betriebs. Die Universitäten Heidelberg, Hohenheim, Konstanz, Tübingen und das Karlsruher Instituts für Technologie (KIT) vereinbarten, den langfristigen Betrieb der Plattform sicherzustellen. Im Rahmen eines Beteiligungsmodells konnten weitere institutionelle und individuelle Partner aus Hessen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Niedersachsen, Thüringen und Sachsen gewonnen werden, die die Plattform inhaltlich und strukturell weiter ausgebaut haben. Daneben haben die Projektpartner eine Instanz des DMP-Tools Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) eingerichtet und auf der Webseite integriert.Vernetzung und Outreach waren weitere wichtige Themen von bwFDM-Info I und II. Mit dem Arbeitskreis der Forschungsdatenverantwortlichen aller Universitäten im Land (AK FDM) wurde ein Gremium etabliert, in dem sich die Beteiligten regelmäßig über ihre jeweiligen FDM-Aktivitäten austauschen und offene Fragen klären. Die E-Science-Tage 2017 in Heidelberg haben als erfolgreiche Fachkonferenz maßgebliche FDM-Akteure bundesweit zusammengebracht. Mit der Koordination der baden-württembergischen E-Science-Projekte aus den Bereichen Forschungsdatenmanagement und Virtuelle Forschungsumgebungen hat das Projekt bwFDM-Info deren Austausch gefördert und Synergien in der Entwicklung geweckt.Dieses erfolgreiche Konzept soll 2019 bis 2023 mit dem neuen Projekt bw2FDM weiterentwickelt werden. Ein Hauptziel ist es, die Aufbauaktivitäten der baden-württembergischen Science Data Centers (SDC) koordinierend zu begleiten, deren Vernetzung untereinander zu intensivieren und ihre Sichtbarkeit für die Forschungscommunities im In- und Ausland zu steigern. Damit soll auch die Nachnutzung der von den SDCs entwickelten Produkten für die Forschungscommunity ermöglicht werden.

This includes data management as well as the individual data analysis and often covers the entire data life cycle. A variety of tools have been developed to store, share, or reuse the data produced in the different domains such as genotyping. Especially imputation, as a subfield of genotyping, requires good Research Data Management (RDM) strategies to enable use and re-use of genotypic data. To aim for sustainable software, it is necessary to develop tools and surrounding ecosystems, which are reusable and maintainable. Reusability in the context of streamlined tools can e.g. be achieved by standardizing the input and output of the different tools and adapting to open and broadly used file formats. By using such established file formats, the tools can also be connected with others, improving the overall interoperability of the software. Finally, it is important to build strong communities that maintain the tools by developing and contributing new features and maintenance updates. In this article, concepts for this will be presented for an imputation service.","2022-09-05","2024-07-08 09:28:01","2024-09-02 11:57:26","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sie stellt digitale Informationsressourcen und Fachportale bereit und unterstützt Forschende beim digitalen Publizieren. Dazu hat sie ein Repositorium für elektronische Dokumente eingerichtet (HilDok). Sie unterstützt die Forschenden technisch und organisatorisch beim Open-Access-Publizieren und verwaltet einen Open-Access-Publikationsfonds. In Kooperation mit dem Rechenzentrum bietet die UB zudem ein Repositorium zur Speicherung, Archivierung, Verwaltung, Verknüpfung und Bereitstellung auch von forschungsrelevanten Daten an (HilData). HilData und HilDok ermöglichen zudem die Verknüpfung von Forschungsdaten mit Forschungspublikationen.Die SUH hat die strategische Herausforderung für sich erkannt und in der Universitätsbibliothek seit März 2018 eine Stelle Forschungsdatenmanagement besetzt. Im ersten Schritt geht es darum, forschungsaktive Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler im Forschungsdatenmanagement (FDM) konkret zu unterstützen bzw. ein \grqqAwareness\grqq zu schaffen, um die Forschenden für das Thema FDM zu sensibilisieren sowie ihre Bedarfe und Anforderungen zu ermitteln. Berücksichtigt wird dabei auch, konkrete Lösungen für generische als auch spezielle Anforderungen der Forschenden unter Berücksichtigung der lokalen Bedingungen zu ermitteln.Die SUH setzt die Beteiligung am Ausbau von Forschungdateninfrastrukturen auf lokaler, regionaler, nationaler und internationaler Ebene fort. In Deutschland hat sich inzwischen der Research Data Management Organiser RDMO als ein wichtiges Werkzeug etabliert und soll auch an der SUH eingesetzt werden. Das seit März 2018 installierte Tool ist an der SUH bisher eine Testinstanz (Stand: Oktober 2018) und wird in den nächsten Monaten von den Softwareentwicklern innerhalb der RDMO-Community kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt bevor erste Workshops an der SUH und ein Nutzen der Forschenden von RDMO möglich sein wird.

To help close this gap, we have elaborated a design concept called `Data Story' drawing on ideas from (digital) data storytelling and aiming at facilitating the appropriation of RDM practices, in particular data curation, sharing and reuse. Our focus was on researchers working mainly with qualitative data in their daily workflows. Data Story integrates traditional data curation approaches with a more narrative, contextual, and collaborative organizational layer that can be thought of as a `story'. Our findings come from a long-term `embedded' evaluation of the concept and show that: (1) engaging with Data Story has many potential benefits, as for example peer learning opportunities, better data overview, and organization of analytical insights; (2) Data Story can effectively address data curation issues such as standardization and unconformity; and (3) it addresses a broader set of issues and concerns that are less dealt with in the current state of play such as lack of motivation and stylistic choices. Our contribution, based on lessons learnt, is to provide a new design approach for RDM and for new collaborative research data practices, one grounded in narrative structures, capable of negotiating between top-down policies and bottom-up practices, and which supports `reflective' learning opportunities – with and about data – of many kinds.","2023","2024-09-02 07:33:27","2024-09-02 07:33:27","","911–949","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mit diesem Kurs verschaffen Sie sich einen Überblick über die verschiedenen Aspekte des Forschungsdatenmanagements und erhalten praktische Tipps für Ihre Arbeit. Es gehört zur guten Wissenschaftlichen Praxis, Forschungsdaten, die Grundlage veröffentlichter Ergebnisse sind, mindestens 10 Jahre lang so aufzubewahren, dass sie lesbar und verstehbar bleiben. Das setzt eine angemessene Dokumentation, geeignete Dateiformate und einen regelmäßigen Austausch der physischen Datenträger voraus. Viele Drittmittelgeber und Wissenschaftsorganisationen erwarten inzwischen, dass Daten nicht nur archiviert, sondern öffentlich zugänglich gemacht werden. Dafür sollten Sie in geeigneten Datenrepositorien abgelegt und mit einem eindeutigen und permanenten Identifier, wie z.B. einem DOI, versehen werden. Wie die Dokumentation, Archivierung und Veröffentlichung funktioniert und welche Hilfsmittel es gibt, erfahren Sie in diesem Kurs.

The symbiosis of heterogeneous measuring devices, FAIR principles, and digital twin technologies is considered to be ideally suited to realize the foundation of reliable, sustainable, and open research data management. This paper contributes a novel architectural approach for gathering and managing research data aligned with the FAIR principles. A reference implementation as well as a subsequent proof of concept is given, leveraging the utilization of digital twins to overcome common data management issues at equipment-intense research institutes. To facilitate implementation, a top-level knowledge graph has been developed to convey metadata from research devices along with the produced data. In addition, a reactive digital twin implementation of a specific measurement device was devised to facilitate reconfigurability and minimized design effort.","2023","2024-09-02 07:33:25","2024-09-02 07:33:25","","468","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ein DMP strukturiert hierzu den Umgang mit Forschungsdaten über deren Lebenszyklus hinweg. Dabei laufen Erkenntnisse zu benötigten oder generierten Datensätzen ebenso zusammen wie deren Lizenzierung, Anreicherung mit Metadaten, notwendige Verarbeitungsschritte und -software oder die Eigentümerschaft im Zeitablauf.

In den zwei folgenden Veranstaltungen wurden die Perspektiven der Forschungsförderer und der Forschenden diverser Fachbereiche beleuchtet. Die abschließende vierte Veranstaltung stellte verschiedene Tools zur Erstellung von Datenmanagementplänen vor. Der vorliegende Artikel informiert über Inhalte und Ergebnisse der vier Workshops und gibt einen Ausblick auf zukünftige Entwicklungen.","2022","2024-09-02 07:33:24","2024-10-29 08:33:49","","103–120","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","data management plan; DMP tools; funders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NFDI, EOSC und andere), ist ein wichtiges zentren-übergreifendes Ziel der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft. Dafür ist es entscheidend, die bestehenden Zusammenhänge der Forschungsdaten-erhebenden und -nachnutzenden sowie die Dateninfrastrukturen (DIS) entlang der FAIR-Prinzipien1 zuordnen. Ziel dieser Erhebung ist es, einen Überblick über bestehende Praktiken und Entwicklungs-stände der Dateninfrastrukturen (DIS) in der Helmholtz Gemeinschaft im Bereich Erde und Umwelt zu erhalten, um eine konsistente Strategie zur Umsetzung eines FAIRen Datenraumes entwickeln zu können.Es stellt sich heraus, dass, den DIS die FAIR-Prinzipien bekannt sind, sie sich mehrheitlich dazu bekennen und bestrebt sind, diese bestmöglich umzusetzen. Dabei wählen sie zum Teil sehr unterschiedliche Umsetzungsstrategien und treffen auf unterschiedliche Herausforderungen und Hindernisse. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die Schwierigkeiten in der Umsetzung mit der Tiefe und organisatorischen Komplexität bei der Implementierung der FAIR-Prinzipien zunehmen. Während beispielsweise einige Kriterien zur Auffindbarkeit (Findability) und Zugriffsmöglichkeit (Accessability) bereits bei vielen DIS z.B. durch den Einsatz von DOIs und Metadatenstandards erfüllt sind, ist esoffensichtlich schwieriger, die Interoperabilität (Interoperabilty) und Nachnutzbarkeit (Reusability) der Daten umzusetzen.Der HMC Hub Erde und Umwelt (EuU) kann aus der Erhebung für den Forschungsbereich EuU eine Reihe von Empfehlungen ableiten. Dazu gehört unter anderem die Notwendigkeit eines einheitlichen Verständnisses von FAIR. Innerhalb des Forschungsdatenmanagements (FDM) sollte der Fokus insbesondere auf eine einheitliche Umsetzung persistenter Identifier (PIDs) / Handles, FAIR Digital Objekts (FDOs), semantischer Konzepte und Provenienz gerichtet werden, weil deren Einsatz wichtige Bausteine für die Umsetzung der FAIR-Prinzipien sind. Infolgedessen könnte die Rolle von HMC sein, den einheitlichen Umgang mit Forschungsdaten innerhalb der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft zu moderieren und zu koordinieren. Dadurch würden Prozesse zu etabliert die es erlauben, dass alle erhobenen Daten in den verschiedenen Forschungsbereichen gefunden, verwendet und einheitlich referenziert werden können.Langfristig gilt es einen Community Co-Design Prozess zu etablieren, der es erlaubt, möglichst konkrete, gemeinschaftlich getragene Vereinbarungen zum Datenaustausch zu treffen und diese in Helmholtz Empfehlungen zum Umgang mit Forschungsdaten, also Policies, umzusetzen. Dadurchwürde ein für alle nachvollziehbarer, interoperabler Helmholtz Datenraum geschaffen.","2022","2024-07-08 09:28:01","2024-09-02 10:04:13","","","","","","","","","HMC Report","","","","HMC Office, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research","Kiel, Germany","","","","","","","","DOI: Andrea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To maximize the impact of diverse research strategies, multidisciplinary, large-scale neuroscience research consortia face a number of unsolved challenges in RDM. While open science principles are largely accepted, it is practically difficult for researchers to prioritize RDM over other pressing demands. The implementation of a coherent, executable RDM plan for consortia spanning animal, human, and clinical studies is becoming increasingly challenging. Here, we present an RDM strategy implemented for the Heidelberg Collaborative Research Consortium. Our consortium combines basic and clinical research in diverse populations (animals and humans) and produces highly heterogeneous and multimodal research data (e.g., neurophysiology, neuroimaging, genetics, behavior). We present a concrete strategy for initiating early-stage RDM and FAIR data generation for large-scale collaborative research consortia, with a focus on sustainable solutions that incentivize incremental RDM while respecting research-specific requirements.","2022","2024-09-02 07:33:23","2024-09-02 13:06:30","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DMP tools support the development of DMPs. Among the variety of tools available, it can be difficult for researchers, data stewards and institutions to choose the one that is most appropriate for their specific needs and context. We evaluated 18 DMP tools according to 31 requirement parameters covering aspects relating to basic functions, DMP contents, technical aspects and user friendliness. The highest total evaluation scores were reached by Data Stewardship Wizard (703.5), DMPTool (615.5) and RDMO NFDI4Ing (549.5). The tools evaluated satisfied between 10 % and 87 % of the requirement parameters. 11 tools cover at least half of the parameters. In terms of correlation among the tools, which indicates to which degree their scores in the different requirement parameters are alike, we found the highest correlation for ezDMP and GFBio DMPT. Regarding the relatedness between the tools, 85 % of the DMP tools were positively and 16 % negatively correlated. Accounting for the recent developments in the area of DMP tools, this study provides an up-to-date evaluation that can support tool developers in identifying potential improvements, and hosting institutions to select a tool suited to their specific needs.","2023","2024-09-02 07:33:23","2024-10-29 10:05:25","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RDMO; DMP tools; comparison; DMPTool; DS-Wizard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Als Grundlage für die weiteren Arbeiten wurde eine Leitlinie zum Umgang mit Forschungsdaten erarbeitet und seitens der Universität verabschiedet. Ausgehend von einem umfänglichen FDM-Service-Portfolio wurden erste Maßnahmenpakete entwickelt, die mit einer realistischen Aufwandsabschätzung eine Grundlage für ein universitätsweites FDM innerhalb der nächsten drei Jahre legen sollen. Die Maßnahmen basieren im Wesentlichen auf dem Aufbau von Informations-, Beratungs- und Schulungsangeboten und sollen die Vernetzung der FDM-Akteure stärken.

In the course of a year, the status quo of the handling of research data at the university, the faculties, institutes and research projects was investigated. As a basis for further work, a guideline for the handling of research data was developed and adopted by the university. Based on a comprehensive RDM-service portfolio, first packages of measures were developed in order to provide a basis for a university-wide RDM within the next three years, also giving a realistic estimate of costs. Essentially, the measures are centred on the development of information, consulting and training services and are intended to strengthen the networking of RDM actors. Another field of activity is the development of digital services in the area of storage and visualisation of research results.","2018","2024-09-02 07:33:32","2024-09-02 12:53:39","","28–46","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vielmehr bedürfen Forschende bei der Planung und Umsetzung ihres Datenmanagements maßgeschneiderter Unterstützung, die sich an ihrer Arbeitsrealität und den Vorgaben bzw. Anforderungen ihrer Disziplin orientiert. Mit den sogenannten Domain-Data-Protokollen versucht Science Europe diesem Bedarf nach disziplinspezifischen Werkzeugen zu begegnen. Dabei handelt es sich um eine Art von vorausgefüllten Musterdatenmanagementplänen, die speziell auf die Anforderungen einer bestimmten Disziplin bzw. Forschungsgemeinschaft ausgerichtet sind und die die Generierung nachnutzbarer Daten im Sinne der FAIR Data Principles fördern. Im Verbundprojekt Domain-Data-Protokolle für die empirische Bildungsforschung wurde ab Juni 2019 ein erstes Domain-Data-Protokoll für die Bildungsforschung, in Form des Standardisierten Datenmanagementplans für die Bildungsforschung (Stamp), entwickelt.

National libraries engage with the data community to raise awareness of the relevance of data management and so promote themselves as an essential place for data repositories and the researcher community.

Da der Kontext, in dem Forschungsdaten (FD) generiert werden, disziplinspezifisch ist, gilt dies auch für das FDM bzw. Schulungen zum FDM. Um allgemeine Schulungsangebote mit fachspezifischen Inhalten zu ergänzen, bieten sich Kooperationen von generisch aufgestellten FDM-Servicezentren an Hochschulen oder außeruniversitären Forschungsinstitutionen mit disziplinorientierten Einrichtungen oder Bibliotheken wie ZB MED – Informationszentrum Lebenswissenschaften an. In diesem Kontext hat ZB MED einen Trainingsworkshop zu FDM in der (Bio-)Medizin ins Leben gerufen, der in Zusammenarbeit mit FDM-Zentren an deutschen Universitäten mit medizinischer Fakultät für die Zielgruppe der Forschenden durchgeführt wird. Die FDM-Zentren decken dabei generische Aspekte des FDM ab und stellen ihre lokalen Dienste vor. ZB MED ergänzt dies mit (bio-)medizinspezifischen Aspekten des FDM, stellt ZB MED-Dienste vor und präsentiert Ergebnisse der Fachkonsortien der Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI), an denen es beteiligt ist. In diesem Zusammenhang werden frei wiederverwendbare Trainingsmaterialien (Open Educational Resources, OER) erstellt, um Forschende im Umgang mit ihren Daten zu unterstützen.

The RDM strategy of a project is usually formalized as a data management plan (DMP)—a document that sets out procedures to ensure data ﬁndability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR-ness). Many aspects of RDM are standardized across disciplines so that data and metadata are reusable, but the components of DMPs in the plant sciences are often disconnected. The inability to reuse plant-speciﬁc DMP content across projects and funding sources requires additional time and effort to write unique DMPs for different settings. To address this issue, we developed DataPLAN—an open-source tool incorporating prewritten DMP content for the plant sciences that can be used online or ofﬂine to prepare multiple DMPs. The current version of DataPLAN supports Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects, as well as projects funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Furthermore, DataPLAN offers the option for users to customize their own templates. Additional templates to accommodate other funding schemes will be added in the future. DataPLAN reduces the workload needed to create or update DMPs in the plant sciences by presenting standardized RDM practices optimized for different funding contexts.","2023-10-24","2024-09-02 11:30:02","2024-10-29 10:06:02","2024-09-02 11:30:02","159","","11","8","","Data","DataPLAN","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\lanza01\Zotero\storage\VVQ4BD45\Zhou et al. - 2023 - DataPLAN A Web-Based Data Management Plan Generator for the Plant Sciences.pdf","","DMP tools; plant science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Um Einstiegshürden zu senken und das Konzept DMP mit Mehrwert für dieForschung handhabbar zu gestalten, bietet die RWTH Aachen University neben Informationen, Beratung und Training auch Workshops zur instituts- oder fachspezifischen Anpassung und Umsetzung von DMPs an. Das Erstellen sinnvoller DMPs ist sowohl für die Forschenden als auch für die Unterstützung auf Seiten der Infrastruktur-Dienstleister aufwendig, nicht zuletzt, weil Community-Lösungen für viele Fachbereiche gleichermaßen wie Umsetzungsbeispiele zur Integration von DMPs in die Forschungsprozesse fehlen. Deshalb sollten zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt DMPs so kompakt und niederschwellig wie möglich gehalten werden, damit der Aufwand bei der Erstellung gering ist und das Konzept von den Forschenden akzeptiert wird.

RADAR wird von FIZ Karlsruhe - Leibniz-Institut für Informationsinfrastruktur betrieben und wendetsich derzeit primär an Hochschulen und außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtungen, die keine eigene Forschungsdateninfrastruktur betreiben oder die RADAR ergänzend zu existierenden disziplinspezifischen Angeboten nutzen möchten. Die Entwicklung von RADAR erfolgte im Rahmen eines DFG-geförderten Projekts (2013-2016) unter Beteiligung von fünf Forschungseinrichtungen aus den Natur- und Informationswissenschaften. (RADAR, 2016) Zu den Projektpartnern zählten neben FIZ Karlsruhe die Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB), die Fakultät für Chemie und Pharmazie der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU), das Leibniz-Institut für Pflanzenbiochemie Halle (IPB), sowie das Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC) des Karlsruher Instituts für Technologie (KIT). Die Kooperation von Informationsinfrastruktureinrichtungen mit Forschenden an Hochschulen und außeruniversitären Forschungseinrichtungen zielte darauf ab, ein bedarfsgerechtes Angebot „aus der wissenschaftlichen Community für die wissenschaftliche Community“ zu ermöglichen. Bereits während der Projektlaufzeit wurde ein nachhaltiges Geschäftsmodell erarbeitet, das nach einer fünfjährigen Anlaufphase ein sich selbst tragendes Dienstangebot sichern soll. Ein wichtiger Aspekt ist dabei der Verzicht auf Projektförderung für den laufenden Betrieb von Anfang an. Seit Ende der Projektphase wird RADAR von FIZ Karlsruhe betrieben, das als Vertragspartner für die nutzenden Einrichtungen auftritt. Die technische Infrastruktur von RADAR wird vom SCC und dem Zentrum für Informationsdienste und Hochleistungsrechnen (ZIH) der TU Dresden bereitgestellt.

A DMP typically describes data handling, archiving, sharing, access, usage and interpretation. A DMP instance applies a certain DMP template in order to address a specific funder or institution for a given use case. However, the structure of existing DMP templates is often designed for funder’s requirements and is consequently generic in scope to address diverse research projects and communities. Thus, these templates often lack guidance on how to structure discipline-specific information in a DMP and information on related consequences, when not following recommended steps. Moreover, additional guidance is often provided in consultations or as unstructured text in specific DMP tools or separate documents and is therefore not prepared for discovery or reuse. To address these challenges, we propose to structure DMP guidance by applying a pattern concept. The pattern concept was developed to collect proven solutions for frequently occurring problems. First patterns covered architecture elements, like specific window forms for specific house forms. By now, the pattern concept is well-established in several disciplines, in particular as software design patterns tackling frequently occurring IT problems and providing solution blueprints. ... With our proposed DMP guidance template, we provide a common structure for DMP guidance facilitating (1) DMP writing across disciplines, (2) the provision of concrete examples (best practices), and (3) the provision of consequences to foster awareness for certain data management topics.","2022-07-25","2024-09-02 13:51:04","2024-10-29 08:20:29","2024-09-02 13:51:04","","","","","","","","","","","","Zenodo","","","","","","","Zenodo","","DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6966878","","C:\Users\lanza01\Zotero\storage\44YGI54D\Henzen et al. - 2022 - A Community-driven Collection and Template for DMP Guidance facilitating Data Management across Disc.pdf","","research data management; data management plan; multidisciplinary; pattern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
